Influence life with life 
Tagore
Live yourself as a light,
Because you don't know,
Who by thy light,
Out of the darkness.
Keep the goodness in your heart,
Because you don't know,
Who would take advantage of your kindness,
Out of despair.
Keep faith in your heart,
Because you don't know,
Who would take your faith,
Out of the confusion.
Trust in your own power,
Because you don' t know,
Who would believe in you,
I began  to believe in myself…
Keep the confidence in your heart,
Because you don't know,
There are people who believe in you,
I began to be confident and self-reliant.
Anytime, anywhere, under any circumstances,
Don't forgetThe dreams I keep in my heart,
Not only did I let myself
Out of darkness and despair and confusion,
More people have to believe it
They are the light in the night
Be grateful to meet in life!
